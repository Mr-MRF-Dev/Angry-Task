AngryTask is a simple task manager that allows you to create, edit, and delete tasks. It is built using Angular and PrimeNG. This project was created to help me learn Angular and PrimeNG. The project is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed [here](https://mr-mrf-dev.github.io/Angry-Task/).

## üöÄ Demo

Check out the live demo [here](https://mr-mrf-dev.github.io/Angry-Task/)!

## üì• Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

   If you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mr-MRF-Dev/Angry-Task.git
   ```

   If you have [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed:

   ```bash
   gh repo clone Mr-MRF-Dev/Angry-Task
   ```

   Navigate to the Project Directory

   ```bash
   cd Angry-Task
   ```

2. Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### ‚öô Using NPM Scripts

You can use npm scripts to **build**, **test**, and **serve** the application. For more information, refer to the `scripts` section in the `package.json` file.

for example:

```bash
npm run start # Serve the application
```

```bash
npm run build # Build the application
```

```bash
npm run test # Run the unit tests
```

and so on...

### üå† Using Angular CLI

[Angular CLI](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) is a powerful tool that can be used to serve, test, and build your application. To use the Angular CLI, you need to have it installed globally. If it's not already installed, you can install it with the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

and then you can use the `ng` command to serve the application. Here are some examples:

#### üçΩ Serve the Application

To start a development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Then, navigate to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/). The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Alternatively, you can run:

```bash
ng serve --open
```

This will open the application in your default browser.

#### üß™ Running Unit Tests

To run the unit tests using [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io), execute the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

#### üì¶ Building the Application

To build the application, use the following command:

```bash
ng build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. This directory will contain all the files necessary for deployment.

#### üìÑ Linting the Application

To lint the application, run:

```bash
ng lint
```

This will lint the application using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Codelyzer](https://codelyzer.com/).
